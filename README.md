# rEFInd-theMe-MatriX
A rEFInd theme based on the scene from the movie Matrix where Morpheus offers the two pills to Neo.

A clean theme for the [rEFInd UEFI Boot Manager](http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/)
based on the default colorscheme.

On the default theme we roll our icons, fonts and add background picture.

## Installation

1. Find the rEFInd directory on your boot volume. For me, it's `/boot/EFI/refind`.
   (Note: you will likely need to do this as root)

2. Copy theme files to the same directories inside the rEFInd directory. (Overwrite (refind.conf file) when copying, if needed. Do so with care at your own risk. This will erase your old refind.conf file. If you don't know what you're doing, it's best not to.)

3. I configured two systems in my refind.conf file: Arch Linux and Windows 8.1 (If you want, you can change it to your liking.)
